<h2>The Exploration of MARS!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This is a platformer in which you are the first explorer dropped off at MARS. Your mission is simple, explore the Martian landscape
and possibly find aliens! 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This is a game made for the 'explorer' types (as the title denotes) and the main goal is simply to explore the landscape. It is more
of a side-scroller type game so it isn't a true overhead scroller like most explorer games.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The Game play is fairly straightforward and you use the arrow keys to control your ship. Collect any gems that show up and avoid touching
the lava!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
1) Platformer: Haven't made one of these yet
2) Side-scroller
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Contrasting display (I think aesthetics are a feature as much as anything else)
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are the first explorer dropped off at Mars to explore the Martian terrain. Explore!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
While NASA promised you they would get you back to Earth, the deeper you explore the more you start to wonder if their promises are true..
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Explorers
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
3-5 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
No real strategies, just avoid the baddies.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets were cloned directly from phasers examples:
	https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/tree/master/examples/assets/sprites
	
or made by me in paint
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game we all played as kids where you were a martian and have a ship where you collect gems. I can't remember the name
